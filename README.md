# Centralize (Abandoned)

Centralize is my personal website. I'll try to make it as complete as possible.  I used an existing Bootstrap-ready HTML theme that I converted to React and heavily modified. Some PHP was involved for the contact form but the main work was in JavaScript & HTML/CSS.

## Installation

The resources are absent from the repo on purpose. Therefore you should pick what you need for reference, this repo isn't a ready to run one (although it would be easy to replace the resources with your own)

The main work on the front end was done in src/components

The backend (in PHP, for the contact form) is in [another repo](https://github.com/AndrewKeymolen/Centralize-Contact-Form)
